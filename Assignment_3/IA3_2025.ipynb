This makes sense as the model gave more weight to words that are more related to higher intensities of positiveness, for example the word \"guys\" was on the TF-IDF positive only list, but not on the SVM positive list. On the other hand the clearly positive word \"kudos\" appeared on the SVM-positive list and not on the TF-IDF positive list.**\n",

When looking at the words that didn't overlap, we see a situation similar to the positive words. A word clearly negative such as \"ruining\" appears in the top SVM-negative words, but not on the TF-IDF negative words. These discrepancies are due to the SVM actually going through the optimization process of finding the words that better classify tweets as positive or negative, while the TF-IDF metric is based on word frequency and has no notion of the labels.**\n",

This word does not appear among any of the top SVM features be it positive or negative. This is because while this company has received both positive and negative tweets, on itself, the company's name is not an indicator of positiveness or negativeness. That's why the model didn't identify it as a useful word for classification.**"

There is little overlap between the words that each model gives the most importance for classification, this implies that both models could perform differently during validation. Focusing on the positive words, the words selected by the SVM model are more generally positive such as \"great\" and \"awesome\". On the other hand, the words selected by the Naive Bayes Classifier are more specific and less general such as the words \"imaginedragons\" and \"fortunemagazine\". This to me indicates that the SVM model will be able to better deal with unseen data, as it gives importance to more general words for classification instead of very specific words in the dataset.**\n"

This preprocessing includes: converting everything to lower caps, removing all emojis, removing \"@\" handles, removed extra whitespace, and finally removing URLS. For the Linear SVM model I used the previously determined best C value of 0.56, and for my Naive Bayes model I used the previous alpha value of 0.24. I used Unigrams+Bigrams for the vectorizer. The ensemble model just uses the average prediction of both Linear SVM and NB models.**\n",
