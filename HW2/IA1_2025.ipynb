        "**The 0.1 learning rate leads to the best training MSE, while the learning rate of 0.01 leads to the best validation MSE. In this case better training MSE does tend to correspond to better validation MSE. The lecture slides mention that this is not always the case and good training MSE performance might lead to overfitting causing bad validation MSE performance. In this case there's no issue in using the training loss to pick a learning rate since we do not observe overfitting, that is the validation loss remains very close to the training loss.**"

This is because without normalization features at different scales for example on the 1000-2000 would require much smaller weights than features on a range from 1-10 in order to lead to the same loss. This can lead to weights becoming numerically unstable reaching really high or small values.**\n",

Plot your MSE loss curve as a function of the epochs once you identify a convergent learning rate.\n",

Also unless you let it run for a long time, it is unlikely to converge to the same level of loss values. So use a reasonable upper bound on the # of iterations so that it won't take forever."
