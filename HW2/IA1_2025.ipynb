        "**Generally the features match my expectation of what makes a house expensive, however there are some features that caught my attention. First I was expecting the number of bedrooms to have a positive impact on the price however in this dataset it has a negative impact with a weight of -0.28. I was surprised to see that the largest positive weight was attributed the grade given to the house. I was also surprised by the small positive impact of sqft_lot, i was expecting the size of the land to be of much more importance to the price.**"

In this case better training MSE does tend to correspond to better validation MSE. The lecture slides mention that this is not always the case and good training MSE performance might lead to overfitting causing bad validation MSE performance. In this case there's no issue in using the training loss to pick a learning rate since we do not observe overfitting, that is the validation loss remains very close to the training loss.**"

This is because without normalization features at different scales for example on the 1000-2000 would require much smaller weights than features on a range from 1-10 in order to lead to the same loss. This can lead to weights becoming numerically unstable reaching really high or small values.**\n",
