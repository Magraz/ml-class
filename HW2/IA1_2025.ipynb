    "# AI534 Implementation 1\n",
    "**Deadline**: Sunday, Oct. 12, by 11:59pm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission Instruction**: Submit 1) your completed notebook in ipynb format, and 2) a PDF export of the completed notebook with outputs (the codeblock at the end of the notebook should automatically produce the pdf file).\n",

    "**Overview** In this assignment, we will implement and experiment with linear regression models to predict house prices based on various features. We will use the same housing data you explored in the warm-up assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement two versions, one using the closed-form solution, and one using gradient descent.\n",

    "You may modify the starter code as you see fit, including changing the signatures of functions and adding/removing helper functions. However, please make sure that your TA can understand what you are doing and why."

    "Which learning rate leads to the best training and validation MSE respectively? Do you observe better training MSE tend to correpsond to better validation MSE? How is this different from the trend shown on page 52 (or vicinity) of the lecture slides (titled 'danger of using training loss to select M') regarding overfitting? Is there any issue with using training loss to pick learning rate in this case?"

    "**The 0.1 learning rate leads to the best training MSE, while the learning rate of 0.01 leads to the best validation MSE. In this case better training MSE does tend to correspond to better validation MSE. The lecture slides mention that this is not always the case and good training MSE performance might be caused by overfitting leading to bad validation MSE performance. In this case there's no issue in using the training loss to pick a learning rate since we do not observe overfitting, this shown by how the validation loss remains very close to the training loss.**"

    "**1.- It does not directly affect the training and validation MSE as normalization is only a linear transformation it doesn't affect the expressive power of the model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.-Normalization is helping by keeping the scale of the input bounded and thus keeping the scale of the weights similar to each other. This is because without normalization features at different scales for example on the 1000-2000 would require much smaller weights than features on a range from 1-10 in order to lead to the same loss. This can lead to weights becoming numerically unstable reaching really high or small values.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.-Since weights will be similar to each other in scale, the gradients will be smaller and not explode leading to divergence as we saw with the learning rate of 1.**"

Note that the learning rate used in previous section will no longer work here. You will need to search for an appropriate learning rate to get some converging behavior. Plot your MSE loss curve as a function of the epochs once you identify a convergent learning rate.\n",
    "Hint: the learning rate needs to be much, much,much, much, much, much, much smaller (think about each much as an order of manitude) than what was used in part 2). Also unless you let it run for a long time, it is unlikely to converge to the same level of loss values. So use a reasonable upper bound on the # of iterations so that it won't take forever."

    "**In my answer to the first question I expected the loss to remain similar and only the weights to change in magnitude. The experiment confirmed my expectation since the loss for both train and validation are very similar when using the normalized and non-normalized data. The main change is in the weights, the normalized weights have values in a range [-0.88, 1.17], while the unnormalized weights have values in the range [-2.14, 6.0]. Some weights of the unnormalized weight set are very small such as the sqft_lot15 weight of -3.4334744771632282e-06 these very small weights can cause numerical stability problems when calculating the gradients. Normalization can help prevent this by keeping the weights similar in scale.**"

    "In the warm up exercise, you all have seen some features are highly correlated with one another. For example, there are multiple squared footage related features that are strongly correlated (e.g., *sqft_above* and *sqrt_living* has a correlation coefficient of 0.878).  This is referred to as multicollinearity phenomeon, where two or more features are correlated.\n",

    "There are numerous consequences from multicollinearity. It makes it more challenging to estimate the weights of the features accurately. The weights may become unstable, and their interpretation becomes less clear.\n",

    "**For the most part, highly correlated features tend to show more variance in their weights. Looking at the sqft_living and grade features both of which are highly correlated, we can see that their variance is among the top 7 highest. The same can be said for the features yr_built and age_since_renovated. This aligns with the correlation matrix shown above.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The most correlated features are: bathrooms, sqft_living, sqft_above, grade, sqft_lot, yr_built, age_since_renovated, year and month. The features most positively correlated to each other are sqft_living and sqft_above, and the most negatively correlated features to each other are yr_built and age_since_renovated.**\n",

    "**Basically having correlated features makes it harder to identify which features are actually responsible for changes in the target. Therefore to improve model performance we can prune some of the highly correlated features and retrain.**"

    "\n",

    "**3. Keeping the first approach's feature modifications, this approach one hot encodes the zipcode feature. This makes the feature space larger, also increasing the amount of weights, but makes noticing differences in the zipcode data easier.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Out of these three approaches the one that led to the best performance was the one hot encoding of the zipcode feature. With this approach the model was able to achieve a loss of 2.35 on the test set. I think it helped the most since the new encoding really separated the different zipcodes making it easy for the model to identify which ones are more relevant than others. Without the encoding the zipcodes are all very close to each other, within the 9000s range and its hard for the model to discern between them.**\n",
