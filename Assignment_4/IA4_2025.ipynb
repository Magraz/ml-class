There are many other word embedding methods (see, for example, this overview: https://www.turing.com/kb/guide-on-word-embeddings-in-nlp), but here we will use GloVe embeddings (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).\n",

These embeddings place words as points in a continuous “semantic” space, where semantically similar terms (such as *good* and *nice*) are located close to one another.\n",

This file contains a subset of words from the IA3 sentiment dataset that also appear in the full GloVe vocabulary, along with their embeddings. Download this file and place it in the same Google Drive directory as the rest of your AI534 data so the notebook can access it.\n",
